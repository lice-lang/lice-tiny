This is the tiny version and experimental version of the Lice programming language.

Still, Lice tiny provides full support for call-by-name, call-by-need, and call-by-value.
In this version, you can only find the basic language constructs (the `def` family, `lambda` family, control flows, boolean and integer operations), list operations and File/GUI/Netword APIs are removed.

I tried my best to make the compiled jar small.
